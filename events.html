				<h2>Beach Run</h2>
				<p class = "description">The Beach Run was a special wasy to get into the summer running spirit. An 8 mile paradise laced with the smell of the ocean in the air, this run allowed runners time to enjoy running, swimming, exploring, and much more with their friends at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. Other activities included beach volleyball and best of all, eating at one of the many restuarants in the local area. The only bad part about the Beach Run was that it has to end.</p>
				<p class = "thanks">Special thanks to Akshara Majiga, Coach Flatow, and Coach Johnson.</p>

				<h2>Lake Tahoe Relay</h2>
				<p class = "description">A new experience for MVXC runners, the Tahoe Relay was a weekend to remember. It featured a beautiful, 72-mile-long trail divided among 7 legs. Although running was fun, the best part of the weekend was the sense of companion ship as runners cheered on their teammates, as well as the social aspects they  got to enjoy before and after running. These included foosball, bocce ball, a jacuzzi, hammocks, and lots of Contact.</p>
				<p class = "thanks">Special thanks to Jason Tsujimoto, Mr. and Mrs. Tsujimoto, Mr. and Mrs. Ma, and Mr. Moradi.</p>

				<h2>Breakfast Runs</h2>
				<p class = "description">Inspired by the Coach Flatow's Saturday morning banana/bagel breakfast, breakfast runs were hosted by the Tsujimoto's and Kingsley Wang. These social runs usually started at the Tsujimoto's house from which runners would venture into the hills of Rancho San Antonio. These slopes were particularly challenging, but runners fought through the pain in order to get back for the delicious meal that awaited them. Cooked by Mr. Tsujimoto, featured breakfasts included waffles, eggs, sausages, juice, and plenty of fresh fruit. The potluck style format also resulted in the occasional box of cereal or gingerbread cookies.</p>

				<h2>Movie "Run"</h2>
				<p class = "description">The Movie Run was a great chance for runners to bond with their teammates while enjoying good food and a great movie. This event started at Icicles in Cupertino where runner indulged on their specialty rolled ice cream. From there runners walked to AMC Cupertino for an evening showing of the new movie, Spiderman Homecoming. Organized by Derek Lee, the Movie Run had high attendance and positive reviews comfirming that it was a success.</p>

				<h2>Half Marathons</h2>
				<p class = "description">In high school cross country, race lengths range from 2 miles to 5 kilometers. Be that as it may, these distances are dwarfed by the monster that is the half marathon. This summer, several MVXC runners took part in half marathons across the world. All the way in India, Aravind and Paru Meyyappan refused to skimp on their summer training, not only participating but placing well in *********. More locally, MVXC runners Triya Roy and Viba ***** raced alongside MVTF jumper Cynthia Gong in the San Francisco Half Marathon. However, even these feats did not compare to the grit and grind of MVXC physical therapist Irina Stiasny who participated in the 26.2-mile-long San Francisco Marathon. Congratulations to all of MV's half marathon/marathon finishers!</p>

				<h2>Mural Painting</h2>
				<p class = "description">Contrary to popular belief, not all XC activities have to involve physical activity. Mural Painting was a great way for runners turned aspiring artists to embrace their artistic sides regardless of skill level. Head artist Alicia Gao conceived a beautiful representation of various XC courses combined into a single, breathtaking scene. With the help of teammates and Coach Jodie Johnson, Alicia's dream became a reality.</p>
