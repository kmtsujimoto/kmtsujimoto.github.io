		<p class = "description">Stelling Loop may not be a runner favorite, but it is a sure staple of every runner's MVXC experience. This may not be the most exciting run, as it is usually advertised as an "easy, conversational run". However, that is not the case for the final stretch down Bubb Road. Many runners know all to well the dangers of running down that treacherous lane where, if not careful, hell will break loose a runners attempt to outkick each other to the finish.</p>

				<h2 class = "sub">Homestead Loop</h2>

				<p class = "description">Homestead Loop is usually intended as a simple, conversational run, but as one truly embraces the wind in one's face and the slight rolling hills of Homestead Road, the run can become something else entirely. For new runners, the exeedingly fast pace that emerges can be a nightmare. For experienced runners, it's still a nightmare, but one to be enjoyed. Homestead provides a challenging but enjoyable run for all, laced with several relieving breaks at traffic lights and a refreshing water break at Homestead High School. Overall, it is a quality run.</p>

		<p class = "description">Phar Lap Loop is relatively new to the running scene, but it has increased in popularity throughout the summer. This venture offers a residential experience as one runs through the side streets of Cupertino, free from most traffic. Although this run is short, a small hill near the halfway point leaves many runners aching, and a fast pace can make it a challenging workout.</p>

				<p class = "description">Not long before the conception of Farlap Loop, Varian Park Loop was the new run in town. Although the loop barely ventures past Stevens Creek Boulevard, the miles pile up on this run making it longer than both Stelling and Farlap Loops. As implied by the name, Varian Park Loop includes a run through Varian Park bringing nostalgia upon many runners who attended Stevens Creek Elementary School at the edge of Cupertino.</p>

		<h2 class = "sub">Hoover Loop</h2>
		<p class = "mileage">Length: 6.0 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Hoover+Park//@37.295809,-122.0398507,340m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m8!4m7!1m5!1m1!1s0x0:0x650f230de791e55!2m2!1d-122.0388185!2d37.2958091!1m0" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
		<p class = "description">The newest of the XC runs, Hoover Loops still hides behind a shroud of mystery. The instructions for this run were lost, so the route one takes is up to each individual runner. Inferred from the run's title, Hoover Loop is likely meant to pass through Hoover Park. Possible routes to get there include railroad tracks, Stelling Road, and even a round-a-out way down Mclellan Road. However, the truth of the run is known by one lone man, Coach Kirk Flatow.</p>
		<div id = "matadors">
			<div class = "text">
				<h2 class = "sub">Matadors</h2>
				<p class = "mileage">Length: 5.5 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.315094,-122.0578681/37.3145999,-122.0653781/37.307193,-122.0727417/37.2949778,-122.0777636/37.2948631,-122.0773595/37.3069425,-122.0728778/37.3113133,-122.0693738/37.3155484,-122.0579211/37.315128,-122.0581517/@37.3119751,-122.0648908,1046m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m16!4m15!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m0!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-122.0652548!2d37.314683!3s0x808fb46614dc74d5:0x3c31184d11ce34cb!1m0!1m0!3e2" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
				<p class = "description">Summer running wouldn't be the same without Matadors. Named after the mascot of Monta Vista High School, Matadors is one of the original MVXC runs. It features a beautiful view of the reservoir and is the location of the Watermelon Run time trial at the beginning of the season. If a run could be run too much, it would be Matadors. Sometimes, runners even complete this run multiple times in the same week.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 class = "sub">Up and Over</h2>
		<p class = "mileage">Length: 6.0 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.313317,-122.056034/37.3012426,-122.0435461/37.2938352,-122.0410019/37.2922497,-122.061826/37.3127661,-122.0549551/37.3133192,-122.0558479/@37.3142919,-122.0557621,679m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e2" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
		<p class = description>Full of hills and steep slopes, Up and Over is enough to challenge any runner. It includes a tedious stretch down railroad tracks followed by a torturous, seemingly endless trek up towards Hunter's Point. At this point, Garrods can be added on to challenge even further, or one can continue down Fire Trail for an easier return.</p>
		<div id = "firetrail">
			<div class = "text">
				<h2 class = "sub">Fire Trail</h2>
				<p class = "mileage">Length: 4.0 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.3132556,-122.0549306/37.2950049,-122.0569007/37.3132226,-122.0549592/@37.2973181,-122.060804,5436m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m10!4m9!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-122.0564372!2d37.3108375!3s0x808fb45edc7b1465:0x394a1e548d0f8a40!1m0!1m0!3e2" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
				<p class = "description">Sometimes used as a sort of hazing ritual for new runners, Fire Trail is a short but painful journey up into the heart of Fremont Older. Many misled freshman have mistaken the slight uphill of Regnart Road as the epitome of the workout, leading to their iminent downfall upon reaching the real, wall-like path that seems to lead straight to the heavens. At least they never make the same mistake again.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 class = "sub">Garrods</h2>
		<p class = "mileage">Length: +2.0 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.2892694,-122.0594017/37.2766865,-122.0605273/37.289093,-122.0594334/@37.2843889,-122.0625328,2718m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e2" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
		<p class = description>Although it is not a run by itself, Garrods is the perfect way to add extra mileage to a run. An extension for REI, Horse, Fire Trail, or Up and Over, this run towards Garrods Farm features a slight uphill that weaves in and out of the surrounding mountains. For some veterans, it even seems strange to do a run without adding on Garrods.</p>
		<div id = "sevensprings"></p>
			<div class = "text">
				<h2 class = "sub">Seven Springs Loop</h2>
				<p class = "mileage">Length: +1.5 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.289333,-122.0582467/37.2907907,-122.0600422/@37.2902107,-122.0597676,1359m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m14!4m13!1m10!3m4!1m2!1d-122.0516183!2d37.2931849!3s0x808fb4e89235417f:0x2009918af5752e45!3m4!1m2!1d-122.0579328!2d37.2936733!3s0x808fb4ec812ddb21:0x15eb92f898d83246!1m0!3e2" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
				<p class = "description">Also located at the top of Fire Trail, Seven Springs Loop is an alternate extension if one gets tired of Garrods. Although slightly shorter, Seven Springs is sometimes viewed as the more challenging of the two because of its steep uphills that exacerbate the fatigue from either REI, Fire Trail, Up and Over, or Horse.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 class = "sub">Horse</h2>
		<p class = "mileage">Length: 6.5 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.315094,-122.0578681/37.3145999,-122.0653781/37.307193,-122.0727417/37.2943271,-122.0693335/37.3104513,-122.056435/37.3132432,-122.0562462/@37.3019853,-122.0630155,3543m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m2!4m1!3e2" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
		<p class = "description">Second only to REI in difficulty, Horse is a run to remember. Branching off of Matadors, the lengthy hill of Horse feels even longer as one is forced to climb hill after hill. Steep and sandy, sometimes runners even feel like their going backwards as they persevere up this slippery slope. However, upon seeing the water tower at the top, the feeling of accomplishment makes every bit of pain worth it.</p>

				<p class = "description">One has not truly lived until one experiences the torture of REI. Forking off of Matadors, REI is surely the longest and hardest of the MVXC runs. It finishes with one of the worst hills imaginable and even the strongest of runners suffer on this incline. Rei is often enhanced by an extension down Down and Under.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<h2 class = "sub">Down and Under</h2>
		<p class = "mileage">Length: +2.0 miles<a class = "map" href = "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/37.2892989,-122.0593625/37.3132558,-122.0549541/@37.31205,-122.0571747,1359m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m9!4m8!1m5!3m4!1m2!1d-122.041202!2d37.2967538!3s0x808fb4e1a9dff667:0xfd3424950c7075f6!1m0!3e2" target = "_blank"><p class = "mileage">See Map</p></a></p>
		<p class = "description">Although it isn't an official run, Down and Under is a commonly used extension to many runs. The reverse of Up and Over, Down and Under allows runners to enjoy the windy Prospect Road which is otherwise overshadowed by the pain of uphills. However, one must still remember the repetitive railroad tracks to come when choosing to occupy this route.</p>

				<h2 class = "sub">Core</h2>
				<p class = "mileage"><a class = "map" href = "test10.html"><p class = "mileage">Click Here For Specific Workouts</p></a></p>
				<p class = "description">Core may not be an actual run, but it is a vital activity for cross country runners. It involves exercises that focus on not only core but other important parts of the body as well. Designed to strengthen and prevent injury, a variety of core workouts can keep runners in top shape and health. Although core may seem like a nuisance to the eager young runner, it is essential if one wishes to be a smart runner and can even improve speed as well as flexibility and strength.</p>
